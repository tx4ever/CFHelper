Welcome to the CFHelper Project
=================================
CloudForms Integration 

This project is created to store CloudForms automate datastores
to easily download and import directly into a CloudForms environment. 

=====================================================================
Each zip file strictly contains ONLY the automation elements to support basic
integration with a given system. 

For example, the datastore_chef_070315 zip file is a datastore export that contains:

Chef: 
- Namespaces
- Classes
- Instances
- Methods

Each datastore will likely contain two domains:

- CompanyABC (Main automation domain with the Chef methods)
- CompanyABC_Variables (Reference domain for storing specific attributes)
